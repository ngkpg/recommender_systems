## üìù Preface

In this article, I summarize several popular techniques for building real-world recommender systems (RS), based on a job portal scenario. Imagine a platform with over a million job-seekers who detail their education and work experience, seeking personalized job matches and actionable career advice!

The approaches described here are tuned for job boards, but are broadly applicable to other domains with minimal adaptation.

## üìä Data Overview

Successful recommender systems rely on integrating various data sources. On a job portal, these commonly include:

**User Data:**
- Demographics: Age, gender, location
- Education: Degree, institution, certifications
- Work Experience: Titles, companies, tenure, achievements
- Skills: Listed skills, proficiency, languages
- Resume: Free-text uploads
- Preferences: Desired roles, industries, salary, work type

**Job Data:**
- Job Title, requirements, skills, description
- Company Info: Name, industry, size
- Metadata: Salary, location, remote options, posting dates

**Interaction Data:**
- Implicit Feedback: Applications, views, saves, rejections, interviews
- Explicit Feedback: Ratings, thumbs up/down, relevance labels

## üîÑ Solution Overview

A solid job-matching recommender system typically consists of:
1. **Data Pipeline:** Gathering, cleaning, transforming, and structuring user, job, and interaction data.
2. **Model Pipeline:** Algorithms to recommend jobs and identify gaps.
3. **Consumption Pipeline:** Delivering recommendations (via email, dashboard, etc.) ‚Äì not covered in this post.

## üßπ 1\. Data Pipeline

**Key Transformation Steps:**
- **Deduplication:** Remove duplicate records (via DB constraints, rules)
- **Standardization:** Normalize formats (e.g., dates, titles)
- **Text Cleaning:** Lowercase, remove stopwords, spellcheck resumes/desc.
- **Skill Normalization:** Map synonyms/variants to unified skill taxonomy
- **Imputation:** Handle missing data (fill/flag/remove)
- **Encoding:** Convert categories to numbers (one-hot/label encoding)
- **Vectorization:** Transform profiles to feature vectors (TF-IDF, embeddings)
- **Interaction Matrix:** Build a user-job interaction grid for collaborative filtering

**Example: Profile Vectorization**
- User: `[NumPy, Python, SQL] | Data Analyst | 2 yrs | M.Sc. | Finance | Boston`
- Job: `[Python, SQL, Tableau] | Data Analyst | 3 yrs | B.Sc. | Finance | Boston`
- Data is extracted using regex/NLP/LLMs and mapped to structured vectors.

**Example: User-Job Interaction Matrix**
- Each cell is a numeric code: e.g., ‚Äú5‚Äù for applied, ‚Äú0‚Äù for no interaction, ‚Äú-1‚Äù for disliked, etc.
- This is the foundation for collaborative filtering.

## üîó 2\. Model Pipeline

### **2.1. Core Components**
- **Hybrid Recommender:** Combines content-based (profile similarity) and collaborative filtering (application/interactions data).
- **LLM (Large Language Model) Integration:** Semantic gap analysis/action plans using prompt engineering or fine-tuning.
- **Feedback Loop:** Simple (rule-based) or advanced (RLHF, reinforcement learning from human feedback).

### **2.2. Example Design Patterns**

**Design #1: Hybrid + LLM (Non-Agentic)**
- Job Recommender: Weighted hybrid of content-based + collaborative filtering
- Gap Finder: LLM analyzes (user, job) pairs, prescribes improvements

**Design #2: Agentic (RLHF)**
- Each user is assigned an agent that learns to rank jobs based on their evolving feedback, using RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback)
- LLM-based agent dynamically adjusts gap detection and action-plan prompts

**Design #3: Multi-Agent LLM with RLHF**
- A team of specialized LLM agents curate jobs, diagnose gaps, and recommend action plans, interacting in dialogue and continuously improved via RLHF.

## üìã Comparison Table (Summary)

| **Design** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Best Use Cases** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **#1. Non-Agentic (Hybrid + LLM)** | Mature, simple, cost-effective, explainable | Less adaptive, slower feedback, less personalized | Large job boards, where stability and scale are priorities |
| **#2. Agentic RLHF** | Highly personalized, adaptive over time, leverages user feedback | More infrastructure complexity, per-user state | Career coaching/mentoring sites focused on personalization |
| **#3. Multi-Agent LLM RLHF** | Max bias correction, high transparency/explainability, best for nuanced goals | Highest cost/complexity, needs ample feedback data, harder to debug | Premium coaching, mission-critical, or highly curated expert services |

## üöÄ Takeaways

- Job recommender systems can range from simple, explainable hybrid models to advanced agentic LLM ensembles.
- Model choice depends on your scale, personalization needs, feedback infrastructure, and tolerance for complexity/cost.
- The technical foundations outlined here extend well beyond job boards ‚Äì any domain dealing with complex catalog-user matching can benefit.
